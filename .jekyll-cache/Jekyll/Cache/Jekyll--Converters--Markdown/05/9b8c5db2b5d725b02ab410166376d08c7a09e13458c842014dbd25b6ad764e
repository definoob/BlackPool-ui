<p>BlackPool aims to become a leading provider of financial derivatives in digital sports marketplaces, including asset valuation indexes, leasing, insurance mechanisms and more, starting with SoRare, the leading blockchain footfall fantasy game.</p>

<p><br />Blackpool has adopted a diversified strategy in order to maximise shareholder returns while benefiting from the entire SoRare ecosystem. This strategy ranges from scouting new gems to investing in star players, managers and being extremely active in the transfer market.</p>

<p><br />This strategy is analogous to the one Chelsea FC is currently pursuing, in which Roman Abramovich has invested more than 1 billion pounds and bought a significant number of players in order to loan them out. This strategy is proving to be one of the most successful strategies in global football today from a business return point-of-view. The loan system is a win-win. It works for the loanees, for the parent clubs and for the recipient clubs. It enables an optimal deal for all parties involved.</p>

<p><br />Indeed, in fantasy games, the best NFT cards are the scarcest ones on the market. One must either pay a high price to buy them, or win them as rewards, which often requires one to already have a very strong squad. As such, the average value spent by users on Sorare is high (several $ETH) and the top 25 users approximately own half of the current global cards market cap ($1M) according to <a href="https://SorareData.com">SorareData.com</a>.</p>

<p><br />A strong advocate of decentralisation, Blackpool will also thrive by providing managers the tools necessary to strengthen their understanding of the market by offering data-driven strategies to maximise profit and even arbitrage opportunities.</p>

<p><br />Loans, lotteries and other exotic trading strategies and solutions proposed by Blackpool will benefit the ecosystem by enabling every manager to have the critical tools they need to compete, thereby establishing a more level playing field for all by aligning scarce (and more performant) players and competing for rewards. In turn, this approach increases supply distribution and fosters user growth.</p>

<p><br />Composed of people from diverse backgrounds, we believe our approach should reflect the wide spectrum of skills Blackpool has to offer. Therefore, Blackpool’s strategy implementations are based on rigorous data analytics achieved via machine learning combined with years of expertise in the football world.  Blackpool will therefore track data such as live news feeds from prominent sports journalists, injuries, contract extensions, and other market rumours, and thereby act accordingly.</p>

<p><br />While Blackpool’s strategy establishes us as a dominant figure in the transfer market, our decision-making will always be done with respect for financial regulations. BlackPool’s vision is to provide value to SoRare and so not to play against any potential Decentralised Financial Fair Play Regulations (DFFPR). BlackPool’s core values are fundamentally: improve the economic and financial capabilities of SoRare fantasy football managers.</p>

<h2 id="decentralized-financial-fair-play-regulations">Decentralized Financial Fair Play Regulations</h2>
<p>Faced with serious and worsening financial conditions in the NFT world, Blackpool’s Executive Board of Directors unanimously approved a Decentralised Financial Fair Play concept for the game’s well-being in June 2020. The concept, developed and supported by the entire gaming family, recognises the need for world-wide action to restrict some of the worst excesses of the game. Its fundamental principles and objectives are:</p>

<p><br />
• to improve the economic and financial capabilities of the clubs, increasing their transparency and credibility;
• to place the necessary importance on the protection of creditors and to ensure that clubs settle their liabilities with employees, social/tax authorities and other clubs punctually;
• to introduce more discipline and rationality in club football finances;
• to encourage clubs to operate on the basis of their own revenues;
• to encourage responsible spending for the long-term benefit of football;
• to protect the long-term viability and sustainability of the game’s stakeholders.</p>

<p><br /><strong>(These principles are fantasy principles and are not of a legally binding character)</strong></p>
